# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
As we live in the age of artificial intelligence, we interact with computers in many aspects of our lives. Our communication with machines is no longer dependent on the keyboard or mouse, but our communication methods have become diverse. It can be via many means as image, touch, or voice. Since voices can be understood based on the words spoken and how they are said as well, in this research, I would focus on speech emotions detection. Recognizing the feelings behind the words would help to improve the audio-based interaction between us and computers. So the research question I will answer is as follows " Which machine learning model is best for speech emotion recognition?".
